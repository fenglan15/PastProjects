# Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling 

## About 
Explored the Superconductivity datasets by utilizing different types of visualizations, including matplotlib and seaborn. With heatmap and pairplot, successfully chose and extracted the representative features, which had little or no collinearity with each other, from each dataset, and combined them into a new dataset. Figured the ridge regression model fitted the new dataset the best after applying the linear, ridge regression, and lasso models to the new dataset. Performed the random forest model on the dataset and found out this model has 99.8% accuracy when predicting superconductorsâ€™ critical temperature.
